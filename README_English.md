# ABSTRACT
Usage of Machine Learning through the Apriori Algorithm on FC Barcelona's basketball team to identify the most efficient sets of players, the relationships between them, assign a new statistic and establish a predictive model on the Final 4 of the 2021-2022 Euroleague season. 

## ASPECTS TO KEEP IN MIND
Code has been created with Python through the programming platform Google Colab. 

Most used libraries are *numpy*, *pandas* and *mlxtend.frequent_patterns*.

*.csv* data files are imported locally into the platform itself.

The code file and its comments are mostly written in catalan, if there is any doubt about it you can mail me at _miquelvillaro2000@gmail.com_.

## STRUCTURE
1. Data wrangling & preprocessing
2. Position-wise algorithm.
3. Position-less algoritme
4. Player score
5. Interactive program
6. Euroleague Final 4 predictions
7. Optional file downloads
