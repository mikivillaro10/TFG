# SUMMARY
Utilization of Machine Learning through the Apriori Algorithm at FC Barcelona Basketball in the EuroLeague competition to identify the most efficient player sets, the relationships between them, attribute statistics to them, and establish a predictive model for the Final Four of the 2021-2022 season.

## ASPECTS TO CONSIDER
The code was implemented in Python using the Google Colab platform.

The libraries *numpy*, *pandas*, and *mlxtend.frequent_patterns* are used.

The .csv data files are imported locally on the same platform.

## STRUCTURE
1. Data Pre-processing
2. Algorithm dependent on playing positions
3. Algorithm independent of playing positions
4. Player score
5. Interactive program
6. Predictions for the Final Four
7. Optional file download
